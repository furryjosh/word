#Word
================
A simple webapp that takes a given inputted path, and then returns a count of all of the
words found on .txt files that are found on that path.  The app searches the path then
unzips any zipped files and folders that may exist within a zipped file.  It finds any
.txt files and then scans them for words.

Setup
================
1. Install java
2. Install maven
3. Install tomcat
4. If running on a local machine you will need to set it your configurations so that you
   make an exploded war that gets deployed to your tomcat server.
